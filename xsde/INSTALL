Generated Code Prerequisites

  run-time:

    - libxsde (XSD/e runtime library, part of the XSD/e distribution)


Building XSD/e

  First build (and optionally install) all the prerequisites listed above.
  Alternatively, you can use the xsde+dep package that includes all the
  prerequisites (except g++ and libxerces-c) and can be built with a
  single 'make' invocation.

  Once the prerequisites are ready, to build the XSD/e compiler in source
  directory simply run 'make'. You can also build in a separate directory,
  for example:

  $ mkdir xsde-i686-pc-linux-gnu
  $ cd xsde-i686-pc-linux-gnu
  $ make -f ../xsde-x.y.z/makefile


Creating Binary Distributions

  A binary distribution contains a pre-built XSD/e compiler binary for
  a particular host development platform as well as the source code and
  simple build systems for the libxsde runtime library and examples.

  The dist and dist-win make targets are used to create binary distributions,
  for example:

  $ make dist_prefix=/tmp/xsde-x.y.z-i686-linux-gnu dist
  $ make dist_prefix=/tmp/xsde-x.y.z-i686-windows dist-win


Installing XSD/e

  Not supported in this version.
