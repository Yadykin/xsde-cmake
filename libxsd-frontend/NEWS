  * Add support for multiple pattern facets.

  * Use normalized base path to construct absolute path.

    the empty string to the AnonymousNameTranslator::translate() function
    for the translation unit.

    with _p.

    by, for example, removing empty compositors where it would not
    change the semantics of the schema.

  * Added min() and max() accessors to the Particle and Compositor
    semantic graph nodes.

  * Added optional strong include key to the schema-per-type
    transformation.

    in both parser and anonymous transformation.

  * Optional location translator can now be passed to parser's
    c-tor to translate included and imported schema locations.

  * Support for the upcoming Xerces-C++ 3.0.0 release.

  * Upgraded to the new boost import stub.

  * Upgraded to the new xerces-c import stub.

Version 1.11.0

  * New transformation, xsd-frontend/transformations/restriction.hxx,
    copies omitted attributes and establishes associations between
    attributes, elements, and wildcards in complex type inheritance
    by restriction.

  * Upgraded to the new boost import stub.

Version 1.10.1

  * Add XML Schema error detection that is missing in Xerces-C++.

  * Update Xerces-C++ import stub to use the include directory
    instead of src for header inclusion.

Version 1.10.0

  * New semantic graph node Annotation and edge Annotates. The parser
    now handles XML Schema annotations and builds the corresponding
    representation in the semantic graph.

  * The library no longer depends on the internal Xerces-C++ headers
    and can be built against an installed version of Xerces-C++.

Version 1.9.1

  * Element wildcard (SemanticGraph::Any) is now present in the complex
    type scope with an auto-generated name.

  * Additional regression tests for wildcard parsing.

Version 1.9.0

  * Upgraded to build-0.3.0.

Version 1.8.3

  * Fix for a bug in the edge case of empty prefix namespace resolution.

Version 1.8.2

  * Fix for a bug in element ordering.


Version 1.8.1

  * Fix for a bug in element group forward reference resolution.

  * Set of regression tests.


Version 1.8.0

  * Support for the anyAttribute wildcard.

  * Substitution edge is now propagated to referenced elements.

  * Special parsing method which returns a graph that virtually
    corresponds to the XML Schema namespace definition with all
    the built-in type.

  * Mixed content flag in SemanticGraph::Complex.

  * Optional proper handling of inheritance by restriction.


Version 1.7.0

  * Added Restricts and Extends edges that model XML Schema inheritance
    by restriction and inheritance by extension, respectively. The parser
    was adjusted to use these edges instead of the generic Inherits edge.

  * Implemented handling of the complex content inheritance by restriction.

  * Fixed the chameleon inclusion code to create one Schema node per each
    unique namespace.

  * Removed support for multiple inheritance in Complex.

  * Added a constructor that takes one node traverser to all edge traversers.


Version 1.6.1

  * Bug fixes in the parser.


Version 1.6.0

  * Support for traversing inheritance graph of enumerations.

  * Support for removal of Names edges.


Version 1.5.0

  * Semantic graph now captures containment relations for elements. New
    semantic graph nodes: particle, compositor, all, choice, sequence.

  * Element and attribute groups are not first-class semantic graph
    nodes: element-group and attribute-group. References to groups
    are still fully resolved (i.e., their content is copied into
    referencing constructs).


Version 1.4.1

  * Upgraded to the version-aware libboost import stub.


Version 1.4.0

  * Moved to the build 0.2 series.

  * Support for the default and fixed values in attribute and element
    definitions.


Version 1.3.0

  * Several bug fixes in the parser.

  * Basic support for union. Union member types are not yet tracked.


Version 1.2.0

  * Bug fixes in the parser.

  * Support for the 'substitutes' relation.

  * A flag that indicates whether an element is global.


Version 1.1.0

  * Basic support for inheritance-by-restriction of complex types.

  * Support for mixed content model by simply ignoring the attribute.

  * Support for xsd:anyAttribute by simply ignoring the declaration.

    for qualified elements and attributes.


Version 1.0.6

  * Bug fixes in the parser.

  * Support for xsd:list.

  * Support for the 'refType' extension attribute which allows to specify
    referenced type for IDREF/IDREFS data types.


Version 1.0.5

  * Bug fixes in the parser.

  * SemanticGraph::Scope::NamesList uses List container instead of Vector.
    This allows changing the semantic graph while traversing it.

  * SemanticGraph::Schema graph node supports multiple incoming Contains
    edges.

  * Traversal::Scope has been extended to support traversal of changing
    semantic graphs.


Version 1.0.4

  * Diagnostics improvements.

  * Bug fixes in the filesystem path handling logic.


Version 1.0.3

  * Bug fixes in the filesystem path handling logic.


Version 1.0.2

  * Parser now handles subsequent inclusion/importing of the same
    schema by creating an appropriate edge in the semantic graph.
    Note that this may result in the semantic graph having cycles
    of Includes/Imports/Sources edges.

  * Support for iteration over Belongs edges in SemanticGraph::Type.
